# Payload Injector
Payload Injector is a tool I've made for the PS4 Jailbreak, based on version 5.05.

based on Specter(Cryptogenic)'s PS4-5.05-Kernel-Exploit

The tool would probably not work on 4.55 so I wouldn't suggest trying.

In order to use this tool the user should first convert his payload to homebrew.js using the included tool bin2homebrew (watch at the bottom).

After converting simply drag the homebrew file into the Payload Injector folder.

This folder can now be sent as an exploit, the user can use Al-Azif's ps4-exploit-host for example in order to send it.

# bin2homebrew :
bin2homebrew is a tool I've made in order to convert payloads to homebrew files, so that the Payload Injector can use those converted payloads.

based on iCyb3r's bin2html

Drag *payload*.bin to the bin2homebrew.exe file.

Now the window shall say that it's converting it to a homebrew.js file.

Upon completion a homebrew.js file will be generated in the same folder the payload is in, and the user may press any key to close the window.
